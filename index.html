    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>And the children were under the blanket.</p>
    <p>The vampires are in the yard.</p>
    <p>Tori says, "Watch out Doreen! Don't let them eat you." But it was too late. Doreen got eaten and after a few minutes, Tori danced with joy.</p>
    <p>"Free at last!" Tori whispered to herself.</p>
    <p>But alas, Doreen wasn't really dead.  SHe had truned into a vampire!</p>
    <p>"Arr, I eat you" said Doreen.</p>
